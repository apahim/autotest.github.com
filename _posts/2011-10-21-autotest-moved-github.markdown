<p>
In order to reduce administrative work, and leverage the good infrastructure
that we have been using to host our svn mirror, the autotest project now moved
most of its infrastructure to github:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code: Now autotest moved officialy to git.</li>
<li>Wiki: The trac wiki was converted to reStructuredText, cleaned up and uploaded to git. Now the wiki is a git repo, that you can clone and edit offline. Also, you can install gollum and view your copy of the wiki offline.</li>
<li>Issues database: We also moved the autotest issue tracker to github. Now make sure you make good use of it :)</li>
<li>Downloads: Now we leverage the ability github has of automatically generating the project tarballs based on git branches.</li>
</ul>
