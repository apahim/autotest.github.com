<p>
We are proud to announce a new release of autotest, 0.13.1. This is a 
fairly boring bugfix release, so nothing really new here, just more of 
the same.

<h1>What is autotest?</h1>

<p>
Autotest is a framework for fully automated testing. It is designed
primarily to test the Linux kernel, though it is useful for many other
purposes such as qualifying new hardware, virtualization testing and
general user space program testing under linux platforms. It's an
open-source project under the GPL and is used and developed by a number
of organizations, including Google, IBM, Red Hat, and many others.
